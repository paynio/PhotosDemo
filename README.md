# PhotosDemo

Demonstrates consumption of Instagram API, displays these in a collection view and then allows for CIImage affects to be added.

## Installation

### Cocoapods

The application uses Cocoapods to install AlamoFire dependencies. Pods are not stored in the repo. As such:

- After downloading/cloning repo, navigate to main directory
- Run ```pod install``` prior to compilation

### Creds

To avoid sharing creds within a public repository, they will be emailed to you separately. Creds must be filled in the Creds.plist file. If creds are not added, the application will force crash on launch (this is expected behaviour to enforce using correct creds).
